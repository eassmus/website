  Hi! I am a computer science and math major at the University of Michigan. I am currently most interested in reinforcement learning research and am working in <u><a href="https://leiying.engin.umich.edu/">Prof. Lei Ying's</a></u> lab. I also work as an Instructional Aide for EECS 203 Discrete Math and as a Grader for ECE 567 Reinforcement Learning Theory at UM.

  Take a look at my <u><a href="/blog">blog</a></u> where I occasionally write about math/cs things that interest me. Also check out my <u><a href="/techstack">tech stack</a></u> including my config/dotfiles for my NixOS/Hyprland setup.
