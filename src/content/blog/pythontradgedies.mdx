Python is a language of all time. Despite its longevity, rich ecosystem, and extensive feature list, the language has some tragic quirks that hurt my brain everytime I encounter them. This is a list of some of my favorites that I will continually update.

<br/>

### List * operator used on lists

This operator is a python classic. It is pretty simple, and I would argue even elegant. Simply take the contents of a list and repeat that $$n$$ times.

Consider the following piece of code:
<br/>

```python
def print_arr(arr):
  for sub_arr in arr:
    print(sub_arr)

nested_arr = [[0] * 4] * 4

print_arr(nested_arr)
```
<br/>

As expected our output is a 4x4 matrix of zeros.

<br/>

```python
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 0]
```

<br/>

Now lets say we edit this array with ```nested_arr[0][0] = 42``` and call ```print_arr``` again. Now we get:

<br/>

```python
[42, 0, 0, 0]
[42, 0, 0, 0]
[42, 0, 0, 0]
[42, 0, 0, 0]
```
<br/>

??????? Witchcraft. It seems that our * operator has repeated the pointer to that list 4 times instead of copying the list. This is gargantuanly unintuitive. Instead we are restricted to the ugly and potentially un*pythonic*

<br/>

```python
nested_arr = [[0] * 4 for _ in range(4)]
```

<br/>

### Function argument defaults

Consider the following:

<br/>

```python
def func(l=[]):
  l.append(1)
  print(l)

func()
func()

# This prints:
[1]
[1, 1]
```
<br/>

?????? ```l``` is not being reconstructed when we use the default argument. Again tragic reference wizardry. The only way I know to work around this is the following:

<br/>

```python
def func(l=None):
  if l is None:
    l = []
  l.append(1)
  print(l)
```
<br/>
